									<p><i>I graduated from San Jose State University with a bachelor of science in Kinesiology, specializing in Rehab Science. I had specialized in rehab science in hopes of becoming a physical therapist, however as I did more internships in the field, I realized that this wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I was lost with what I career I wanted to pursue. However, while watching basketball, I kept hearing about analytics and how it was changing the game of basketball and helping teams win. In NBA, teams like the Houston Rockets and Golden State Warriors had shot three pointers at historic rate and I wondered why they were doing it because it was never seen before. Then I learned that according to the analytics the probability of winning the games goes up when teams shoots more three pointers. Never would anyone have been able to make that conclussion if it wasn't for field of data science. It was then I realized the impact of analyzing data and how it can change how businesses opperate. I wanted to help buisness make better decisions and learn from their past data to make positive impact on their future. As I started to take more courses in data science, the more I found how much data are being produced and the value of data overall. </i></p>
